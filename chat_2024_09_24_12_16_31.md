You can fix that by adding that directory to your system's "Path" environment variable.
A web search for "configure windows path" will show you how.

2. **ChatGPT**: It looks like you have successfully activated the `flutterfire_cli` package, but you're experiencing an issue where the command `flutterfire` is not recognized. This typically happens when the directory containing the executable is not included in your system's PATH environment variable. Hereâ€™s how to fix that step by step:

### Step 1: Locate the Directory
You need to add the following directory to your PATH:
```
C:\Users\Ammar Ali\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin
```

### Step 2: Add the Directory to the System PATH

1. **Open System Properties**:
   - Press `Windows + R` to open the Run dialog.
   - Type `sysdm.cpl` and hit Enter.

2. **Navigate to Environment Variables**:
   - In the System Properties window, go to the **Advanced** tab.
   - Click on the **Environment Variables** button at the bottom.

3. **Edit the Path Variable**:
   - In the Environment Variables window, look for the **System variables** section and find the `Path` variable. Select it and click **Edit**.
   - If you don't see `Path`, look in the **User variables** section and add it there if necessary.

4. **Add the New Path**:
   - In the Edit Environment Variable window, click **New** and paste the following directory:
     ```
     C:\Users\Ammar Ali\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin
     ```
   - Click **OK** to close all dialog boxes.

### Step 3: Verify the Change

1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.

2. **Check the PATH**:
   - Type the following command to verify that the path has been added:
     ```bash
     echo %PATH%
     ```
   - You should see your added directory listed.

### Step 4: Test the Command

1. **Restart Command Prompt**:
   - Close your current Command Prompt window and open a new one.
  
2. **Run the flutterfire Command**:
   - Type the following command:
     ```bash
     flutterfire configure
     ```
   - This should now be recognized, and the command should execute without errors.

### Summary of Steps
- Locate the Pub cache bin directory.
- Edit the system's PATH environment variable to include it.
- Verify the change by checking the PATH in Command Prompt.
- Restart Command Prompt to test the command.

If you follow these steps carefully, you should be able to use the `flutterfire` command successfully. Let me know if you have any other questions!
